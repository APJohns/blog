# Contributing

Welcome to my digital garden! Blogs, portfolios, and all the sites of the sort are mostly a solo experience. I wanted to explore ways to make it more multiplayer. That's why I've made my notes collaborative. If you want to add to an existing note or make a new one, don't hesitate to hit that edit button and put up a PR! After I merge your changes, your GitHub username will be added to the contributors list on that note.
